#Model Machine

Model machine is a library that allows you to model computer systems and CPU instruction sets for the purpose of emulation and education. It is in a pre-release stage right now, but I hope to end up with a library that allows developers to model almost any system conceivable, all in-browser. 

Long term goals include CPU pipelining and multithreading using WebWorkers. 

Short term goals include modeling the MOS 6510 CPU with some small modifications for input and output instructions.

My hope is that this will provide an easy-to-use and inviting platform for learning machine language and assembly language, operating systems, and compilers. Being able to control the virtual hardware will make teaching these concepts that much easier.

Help and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
