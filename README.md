#Isomorphic Typescript Module

This repository serves as a base repository for JavaScript modules intended for use either in a browser or NodeJS.

Modules built using this template can be require()'d based on the folder name just like any other Node module. The build process will also create a bundle file in the dist folder, which can be loaded by the browser or included in another bundle.
